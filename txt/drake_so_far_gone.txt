I'm tryin to do it all tonight, I got plans
I got a certain lust for life, and as it stands
Everything is going as right, as it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands... before it lands

But you can miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make offers and who the hell am I to say (no, no, no)
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let (go, go, go)
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see, everytime, that I'm here
But when I'm not really even here
Black surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in the mars yellin Tux I don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older
So what I tend to do is think of today as the past
It's funny when you're coming in first but you hope that you're last (you just hope that it lasts)

Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up in the air for her
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up

Hey there, pretty girl
You know, exactly what you got
And I don't, blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leave
She just stuck in

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

She doesn't ever worry
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own
She knows, there's more to life
And she's scared, of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

We all got dreams and we all star reachin'
All start peakin, all-star weekend
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin'
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin'
Never satisfied with a nice calm evenin'
You be at the games lookin right, all season
But you always with me, on the night y'all leavin'
Ass low, ass low, I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who
Or why, or how, or when
Tonight is probably 'bout to happen all over again
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you
Uh... because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I'd probably go and tattoo
Your name on my heart
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cause the ones you throw will get her out of

Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlanta, she just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas (ay)
Houstatlantavegas (ay) Houstatlantavegas
And she dance, to this song
And she dance, to this song
And it goes, "Hey now now, watch her go down"
Oohh-ohhh-ohh

[Trey Songz:]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

[Drake:]
Drizzy,
Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you,
They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear,
A lot of you all still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Shape the lines in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.

[Trey Songz:]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

[Drake:]
Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my progress is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So it's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...

[Trey Songz:]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

[Drake:]
Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is

[Trey Songz:]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you

[Lil Wayne:]
Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby I go real hard
No further details boy.

Uh, when did you get like this
Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me

[Chorus:]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

[Verse 2:]
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store

[Chorus:]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

[Verse 3:]
Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But, ion really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You jus tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah

[Chorus:]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to had enough of us

[Chopped and screwed voice - Notorious B.I.G:]
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see ya picture
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya [x2]

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Drake:]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

[Notorious B.I.G:]
I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting, flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that mothafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Drake:]
I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Taking everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

[Notorious B.I.G:]
Draped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Drake:]
Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feels like everything's just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone

[Talking:]
Yeah, I appreciate ya patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's just best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young angel and young lion
You know what it is, uh

[Drake:]
Look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes,
Rose and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma
I'm a stockholder,
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'm a do it reppin, I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars
Sittin there wishing they problems became ours
Cause we have nothing in common
Since I done became star
I done became bigger swerving right in my peer's lane
Same dudes that used to holla my engineer's name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
An show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck English
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is ya girlfriend's waking up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figga
How to get these label heads to offer 'em good figures
And me doing them shows gettin everyone nervous cause
Them hipsters gonna have to get alone with them hood niggas
It's all good I'm going off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta rent a movie called hoes over
Rest in peace to heath ledger but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on ya table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and tez got a cig but I'm no smoker
They just handing chips to me nigga no poker
I'm with it, young money, cash money soldier
My cup runneth over,
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D.r., c.j, an po' I see y'all
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on
Making enough to pay any judge Judy off
First thing I'm a do is free weezy, go

[Lil Wayne:]
And I take probation
I don't want that t.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, big location
Going to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones junior fighting the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me un-guarded
And I'm a cheese head word to Vince Lombardi
Word to marky mark leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the red sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recording I'm just C-4'in
My currency foreign
We are in a league they aren't
Better dig in ya pocket an pay homage
Better cover ya eyes ya face falling
Watch the game from the side I'm play calling
No I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I, damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for ya garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-y no homo I'm on it
Weezy f baby new born bitch
You know what they say bout when ya palm itch
I'm gonna get money money I'm gonna get
Young money in ya tummy and we gonna shit
An get that toilet paper quick like when bone spit
That's right bitch I'm back on my grown shit
That oughta Marvin Gaye no ice just chrome shit
And ya boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream fuck the world with a long dick
Motherfucker I'm me, yeah bitch I'm me
You niggas sweet like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down ya entire street
So fly I'm a take off when I leap, bye
And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money headbutt yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if ya touch my things
I'm shuffling the cards bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like tila tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screaming motherfucker do you hear her

Drizzy drake what the lick read
We make magic boy Roy and Sigfried
Who! young mullah baby, yeah

[Drake:]
Spending every moment in the studio
I'd never said it'd be fair
But when you're all alone I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

[Chorus:]
Come right here
Set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do

No you ain't explainin how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

[Lloyd:]
I been waitin for so long to get you all alone
Now I finally got you right here
So baby I'm a lock my door and disconnect my phone
Cause I wanna make one thing clear
I want you on top
So let ya hair down
I took the night off for you
Girl I'm gonna turn the lights off
But keep ya heels on
They're fittin' for what we're about to do

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

[Chorus:]
Come right here
Set ya bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep ya heels on
They're fittin' for what I'm about to do

"oh oh" [ad-libs]

No you ain't explainin how you want it done
Just be quiet I'll do fine without ya help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yaself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

Oh oh. It's 6 o'clock in the morning at the studio

Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio is in character
As if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggaz the cue to go

So they stick around, kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back

But it's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight close

Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back

Black-diamond bracelets,
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera
Someone got to tape this
I make hits and like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness,
I'm that close

Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles, Cabanas, or Atlanta South
Watching Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out

And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around

So she wonder where my mind is, account's in the minus
But yet I roll around the fucking city like your highness
Got niggaz reacting without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless

And promoters tryna get me out to they club
And say I have fun, but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just see my ex-girl,
Standing with my next girl,
Standing with the girl that I'm fucking right now

And shit could get weird, unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks, and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing

I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryna take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly."
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know.
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em.
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on 'em.
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em."

Oh they did Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to

Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause who have known me, would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me

Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy

Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know

'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm getting better still
Little niggaz put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal

Future said, "'Cause it's Ye shit you better kill."
And I think this got that making-of-a-legend feel
Problem with these other niggaz they ain't never real
Yeah, it's all I can say

[Lykke Li:]
Hands down
I'm too proud for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of

[Drake:]
But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
'cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh, oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh, oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you

[Chorus:]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh, oho

[Drake:]
I know you told me break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah

[Lykke Li:]
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
'cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit

You would do it
You would say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha, hm

I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me

[Drake:]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both n'sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just so wrong
I wonder where my whereabouts?
Where niggas that I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous 'cause you always get approached more
Oh, well, tell her fall back
caught up in some more shit
tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know, yeah, tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...

A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lo-lo-lo-lo-love with me
Oh, oho, oh, oho

You know a lot of girls be thinking my songs are about them, but this is not to get confused, this one's for you

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it

'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'

Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
And you know I be over there

I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there

And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life

Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home

And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until 'em girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with

'Cause baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it

'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister

Magazine paper girl the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle

Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on

Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it

'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it, 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'

I say you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best you the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had best I ever had

See this the type of joint you gotta dedicate to somebody
Just make sure they that special somebody
Young Money
You know who you are, I got ya

[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is drizzy
And I ain't perfect
And I work hard
So I deserve it
And I belong
Right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it
I ain't mister fenny
I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
And I fall in love with girls
Caught up in superficial glammer
Who dress like Sara Jessica
And live like princess Diana
So often they have addiction
And I'm the one that will feed it
But truly you bad enough
Where you don't really even need it
You could show up to the party
On dirty public transit
And I guarantee the camera man will still be snapping candids
Of you and your possie partying
Drinking what you get handed
With your virgin island tans
All looking like you just landed
I don't really understand it
I'm not sure I'm comprehending
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spending screaming

[Chorus (2x)]
I got to be unstoppable [2x]
Ay ay ay ay you don't like [2x]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
My name is whezzy
I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard working
Bizarre circus
That's what my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I laying on my back I'm never backing down
So over stand me
I got a condo in Miami
And my door mat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana
But I never pulled a hami
And I got a condo in Atlanta
And I always wear a bandanna
And when it come down to stunning
You boys are just bunting
And I swagging for the fence
Your girl hanging from my dick
Your girl singing to my shit like
A lo lo lollipop
She say I get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
And she say I pick that pussy better than her gynecologist
Hold this
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick
Old bitch
Young bitch
But I be like damn
All I got is one dick

[Chorus (2x)]
I got to be unstoppable [2x]
Ay ay ay ay you don't like [2x]

[Lil Wayne:]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Drake:]
Uh, hardly home but always repping
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake you always resting
And when they call you the answer
You are hardly questioned

I, I'm doing classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas situations they are all depressing
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing

Now I run the game, you stupid mothersuckers
I see all this money through my Ohio state buck eyes
Shit been going good, but good could turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her
And I'm about to get her

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

[Drake:]
Yeah, wrong way down a one way
Women don't get saved 'round me even on a Sunday
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell 'em "Drake is just a younger you."

And shorty wanna party so don't let your girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me giving her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther

I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games lady
Have you counting money going dufflebag-crazy
Sipping on Pink Floyd and puffing Wayne Brady

Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze
You been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze

I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right
You look nice
And your frame makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well, alright
Guess I might
Know what? Fuck it. Yes, I will
I am more than what you bargained for
And nothing less than real
Put it to your life

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

[Bun B:]
Bun B, king of the trill
Also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic
I'm dope and yes I'm focused

The gangster recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust

Or maybe like a python
That's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone
So let me drop this iBomb

I palm the game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike

Bun and Wayne and Drake in here
Man this gon' be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white

Try to cross me over
I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks
Like David Letterman's Late Night

This that major moment you've been waiting on for too long
The best that ever did it and doing it on a new song
UGK and Young Money too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton
So what the fuck is you on?

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

[Lil Wayne:]
I am the leather-jacket, black-glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag boy

Soowoo bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you bitch
And I keep that toaster you can come and be my strudel bitch

I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in
I'm a start shooting in a mosh pit

Fuck is you talking 'bout
Weezy in your mouth now
Weezy what you talking 'bout
(Young Mula Baby)

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
Best believe I understand

It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK
You can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
You can run and tell my city it's on

I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind
There is nothing I could do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go

When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together, make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

The girl or the world?
You see: someone gotta lose
I thought I could have it all
Do I really got to choose?

What good is all the cash, if it doesn't buy time?
And what good is being famous, if I'm never on your mind?

Night's fallen, light's glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't wanna feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going

Is it worth it? That decision?
'Cause hearts break and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'mma dust my shirt and fix my pants
'Cause I better look good, girl
If this my chance I swear

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long
But please don't move on

You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else
You don't need no one else

[Omarion:]
Even though your all alone
All I know when I am gone

I just wanna keep you warm
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back

Yes, I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there

Cause when I'm all alone I think about your face
And how I wanna touch, I'm so far away (I'm So)

All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah

[Chorus:]
Don't go missing
fly with me
Don't go missing
fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing
fly with me
check it out, check it out
Don't go missing
fly with me, fly with me

[Drake:]
I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet

Promise that I won't forget
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back

Yes, I'll be there
Yes, I'll be there

About to board a flight
Sittin' at the gate

I just wanna touch you
But I'm so far away (I'm so)

All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh

[Chorus]

Uh, I'm just so far gone, october's own, Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong, where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown, parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

[Talking:]
You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me.

[Verse 2:]
Uh, And life is so insane, look what I've became, tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain...

[Talking:]
Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.

This here is on some truthful shit!
It's seems like everything I do you're used to it!
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with!
That's when I gotta hide
What I'm feeling inside

So you still think I am confident and dumb?
Is this gonna last?
You're up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feels like I'm in crazy competition with the past
That's why I gotta ask

Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Girl
(Aye Aye Aye)

This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide
And put mistakes aside

So I don't ever question you and damn
I can't even find the perfect brush
So I can paint what's going through my mind
Racing 'gainst myself but I'm a couple steps behind
That's why I gotta ask

Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin' brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Oh, girl
(Aye Aye Aye)

Is anything I'm doing brand new?
New, new, new, new, new
Oh, is everything I'm doing too late?
Late, late, late

Did he take your clothes off just like this?
Did he give you loving just like this?
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?
Tell me, baby, am I too late?

Is anything I'm doing brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

Show me if this is brand new
Brand new, brand new

Black Hearts on my card again
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order in
And tell Gee to put his feet up on the automin
We just up against a bunch of rappers
I go harder then
Damn I'm so catch-trina smarter then
Alot of these niggas swear
The coaches brought the starter in
Yea and I'm the type to tell your daughter things
I float high don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself suicide bars I kill myself Charge it to the game I bill myself
And I don't feel ya'll but I feel myself
Auntie Doe tell em' I deserve a mozeltov
I'm rapping like a Sheppard with the mussel off
I'm next to blow PAUSE
And I can't hear the critics
Talkin over the applause
Yeah I tried to tell em future let em know
Sending haters all my love X and O
I got a black box wear suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's probaly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl riding in your dream car yeah...
And the visual is stunning
I hope they document what I'm becoming
CONGRATULATIONS

[Verse 2:]
So What you want an award or something
I'm at the private airport boarding somethin
I see nothing from a far but I'm far from nothin
Put on your Poker Face
I'll pull ya card if you bluffin
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a Monopoly catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we'll pull ya card
And find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breaking world records

Unless it's gunpoint or somethin

Phone blowin up so I'm cuttin off my cellular

Know that on to my Nebula
I will break a leg
Break an arm
And a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you can never beat my ass PAUSE
Again DAMMIT ya'll again ya'll
Pretend that we are
Some men that get it on and in
I die before I lose cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll
Then don't bother him
And yes I fucked this game
But I won't father them

[Verse 3:]
It's like these days man I'm booked
And I'm busy Dad named me Drake
Foots named my Drizzy
They try to tell me I'll never be nothing
But a Protege but if you watch the VMA's
There's nothin more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a POPPY
And damn how I get so nice
I done spent it all once
Bout to get rich twice
Surprise party Bitch now it's on and poppin
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain Snatch Flow they say get it off yo chest
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin I bet

Hit me at the office same extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should
Pay Attenion

[Lil Wayne:]
