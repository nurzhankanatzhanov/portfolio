Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleepless til noon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Unless you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
Then play you will
I pray you will

Mrs. So-Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
One day you will
I pray you will

When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
If you will
I pray you will

I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you
About you

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will you will
Hey hey hey hey
Please say you will
For real
I pray you will

My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
And all I got was a brand new sports car
Uh

[Chorus:]
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho

[Verse 2]
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
I seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before

[Verse 3]
My god sister gettin' married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh ho
Oh ho
Oh ho

And I can't, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no I can't stop

Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit it
Oh ho, oh ho, oh ho
Oh ho
Oh... oh ho

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so cold
As the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me yo
I mean after all the things that we been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know there are some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road,
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we weren't gonna speak so
Why we up 3 A.M. on the phone?
Why would she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know she's hot and cold
I won't stop won't mess my groove up
Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leaving me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Talking talking talking talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So why I got something new to see?
And you just gon' keep hating me
And we just gon' be enemies

I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight
Into the night

In the night, I hear them talk the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

It's amazing, I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening
I'm exhausted, barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong
I'm a problem
That'll never ever be solved

[Chorus]
And no matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x2]
It's amazing

I'm a monster, I'm a maven
I know this world is changing
Never gave in, never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

[Chorus]
No matter what, you'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing

[Young Jeezy]
I'm amazing (amazing), yeah I'm all that (all that)
If I ain't on my grind than what you call that (what you call that)
Victorious, yeah we warriors
We make history, strive for victory (yeah)
Standing at my podium, I'm trying to watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure either let the feds catch ya (yeah)
I'm amazing born on a full moon
I was breed to get it in, no spoon
That's why I'm so goon summer time no joke
Big family small house, no room
They like "Oh God, why he go so hard
Look what he's been through, he deserves an applause"

[Outro]
So amazing, so amazing, so amazing
It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing [x4]
It's amazing

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, SYSTEM OVERLOAD
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-no!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
You lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
You lose

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

So keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
Your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown
You lose
You lose
You lose
You lose
You lose

[Intro: Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone
A little time out might do you good, might do us good
Before we be done for good
Cause I make it good I could make it hood
I can make you come I can make you go
I can make you high I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky hey maybe so

You be up in mine checking through my cell phone baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight oh here we go
Baby don't worry about it

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do

[Verse 2]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude leave the attitude way back at home
Yea you see em look
Baby let em look give us cold looks cause we look cold
Yea you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
Till you finally let that thing go
You wanna check in to the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed
Baby don't worry about it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

[Chorus]
Anyway they don't know you like I do

Anyway they don't know you like I do

[Verse 1]
Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That a turn my life to Stephen King
Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Now I don't need no Robocop

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history
You like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it goin? on
I told her some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now....drop it...drop it

[Chorus]
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You moving like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Somebody please make her stop

[Verse 3]
Stop...drop...roll...pop bitch I'm cold....I
Ain't used to being told stop
So I could never be your robot
Fast or slow you can stay or can go
Now, now that you know, now, now that you know
Yea I had her before but that happened before
You get mad when you know so just don't ask me no more
Ok, ok, ok, uh, uh
It ain't ok, ok, ok

[Outro]
You spoiled little LA girl
You're just an LA girl

Oh you're kidding me

Waiting on a dream

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right
To put up a fight
But not quite
Cause you cut off my light
But my sight
Is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Oh how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

[Kanye West]
I got my life
And it's my only one
I got the night
I'm running from the sun
So good night
I made it out the door, door, door, door,door
After tonight
There will be no return
After tonight
I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road
And letting you know
LETTING YOU KNOW

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Kanye West]
Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gon' do mine
You do you cause I'm just gon' be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
And the night is young
The drinks is cold
The stars is out
I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well now you know

[Chorus Kanye West]
Tell everybody, EVERYBODY that you know
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Lil Wayne]
I got the right
To put up a fight
But not quite
Cause you cut off my light
But my sight
Is better tonight
And I might see you in my nightmare
Oh how'd you'd get there
Cause we were once a fairy tale
But this is farewell

Babygirl I'm finished
I thought we were committed
I thought we were cemented
I really thought we meant it
But now we just repent it
And now we just resent it
The clouds is in my vision
Look how high that I be getting
And it's all because of you
Girl we through
You think your shit don't stank
but you are Mrs. P-U
And I don't see you
With me no more
Now tell everybody THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW

[Chorus: Kanye West]
THAT YOU KNOW
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW

And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW

On lonely nights I start to fade
(On lonely nights I start to fade)
Her love is a thousand miles away
(Her love is a thousand miles away)
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Memories made in the coldest winter

It's 4am and I can't sleep
(It's 4am and I can't sleep)
Her love is all that I can see
(Her love is all that I can see)
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

Memories made in the coldest winter
Winter, winter

Goodbye my friend will I ever love again
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again
Goodbye my friend will I ever love again

If spring can take the snow away
(If spring can take the snow away)
Can it melt away all of our mistakes
(Can it melt away all of our mistakes)
Memories made in the coldest winter
Goodbye my friend I won't ever love again

Never Again

Wise men say
Wise men say
Wise men say
The baddest niggas out there bro
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love

Its so crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what real love is about

Do you think I sacrificed real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?

There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy

Its funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
Its like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing

What does it feel like to live real life to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel
Do you really have the stamina...
For everybody that sees you and that say 'where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you and says 'sign my autograph'
For everybody that sees you and says that 'you all that'
You all that
I just want to be a real boy,
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes...

And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me I cant find her no more,
I cant find her no more I cant...
the only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream

And the fame will be got caught
And the day I moved to LA
Maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American dream,
Chasing everything we seen
Up on the TV screen
And when I- the Benz was left
And the clothes was left
And the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
You spent the doughs to death
And tell me what-tf for a real boy

They say Kanye you keep it too real boy
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
