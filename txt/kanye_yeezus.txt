[Verse 1:]
Yeezy season approaching
Fuck whatever y'all been hearing
Fuck what, fuck whatever y'all been wearing
The monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinsons
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran (Huh)

[Hook:]
On sight
On sight

How much you wanna give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up
How much do I not give a fuck?
Let me show you right now before you give it up

[Bridge:]
He'll give us what we need
It may not be what we want

[Verse 2:]
Baby girl tryna get a nut
And her girl tryna give it up
Chopped em both down
Don't judge 'em Joe Brown
One last announcement
No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the bleau she tried to sip the fountain
That when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth

[Hook:]
On sight
On sight

[Outro:]
Ugh, huh
Right now, right now
I need, I need
Right now

For my theme song, my leather black jeans on
My by any means on, pardon I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom but watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman at the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in, came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking. Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics, here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would have been blacked out on your ass

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit, fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf, soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king, back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room bitch, stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit, them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on, homie, what happened?
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
(Ready, ready for action)

Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we're livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit's about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Yo mi tek har outta bugah red and put her in a tall skirt

[Intro]
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

[Hook]
I am a god
Hurry up with my damn massage
Hurry up with my damn ménage
Get the Porsche out the damn garage
I am a god
Even though I'm a man of god
My whole life in the hands of god
So y'all better quit playing with god

[Verse 1]
Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hating-ass niggas who'll fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fucking backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ivan, diamond, Chi-town shining
Monop' in this bitch, get a change of climate
Hop in this bitch and get the same thing I'm in
Until the day I get struck by lightning

I am a god
So hurry up with my damn massage
In a French-ass restaurant
Hurry up with my damn croissants
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Verse 2]
I just talked to Jesus
He said, "What up Yeezus?"
I said, "Shit I'm chilling
Trying to stack these millions."
I know he the most high
But I am a close high
Mi casa, su casa
That's that cosa nostra
I am a god
I am a god
I am a god

AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!

[Outro: Justin Vernon]
Ain't no way I'm giving up. I'm a god

My momma was raised in an era when,
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doing clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself.
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And there's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come here, please buy more"
What you want a Bentley, fur coat and diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things
Used to only be niggas now everybody play me
Spending everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

[Hook:]
You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

You see it's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2:]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwing hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm about to wild the fuck out
I'm going Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwing contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw on some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that private owned prison
Get your piece today
They Probably all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout their maid
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Justin Vernon:]
I can hold my liquor
What this man can't handle is me
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

[Chief Keef:]
I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Kanye West:]
Bitch, I'm back out my coma, waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover, slightly scratch your Corolla
OK, I smashed your Corolla, I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over, ask me why I came over

One more hit and I can own you, one more fuck and I can own you
One cold night in October, pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra, pussy had me dead

Might call 2Pac over,
Yeezy's all on your sofa, these the Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners, you love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover,
Even when I blow doja

Then her auntie came over, skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus, bitch you don't even know us

Baby girl, he's a loner, baby girl, he's a loner
Late-night organ donor, after that he disown you

After that he's just hopeless, soul mates become soulless
"When it's over it's over"
And, bitch, I'm back out my coma

Calling up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

[Justin Vernon and Kanye West:]
I heard you need a new fad (a new girl)
I heard you need a new stack (a new girl)
I heard you need a new phone (a new girl)
I know your 'rents ain't be home (a new girl)

Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Oh I wanna phone home

[Kanye West:]
Damn, your lips very soft
As I turn my Blackberry off
And I turn your bathwater on
And you turn off your iPhone
Careless whispers, eye fuckin', bitin' ass
Neck, ears, hair, legs, eating ass
Your pussy's too good, I need to crash
Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass
Chasin' love, all the bittersweet hours lost
Eatin' Asian pussy, all I need was sweet and sour sauce
Tell your boss you need an extra hour off
Get you super wet after we turn the shower off

[Assassin:]
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting
Just a badman ting a-dat man do
Action ting, yo, a badman ting

I'm a badman if you know say
Disrespect we no tek, no way José
Try that 'pon February the 30th
That's right, couldn't try that no day
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like a aerosol can
When we roll 'round 'pon your block
Nuh badda feel seh we won't spray, like an aerosol can
We a gon' smile 'pon court day
Becuh we beat murder charge like O.J

[Kanye West & (Justin Vernon):]
That's right, I'm in it
(Should've known I would fall)
I'm in it
(Steppin' on cracks on the floor)
That's right
(And your boys at your door)
That's right, I'm in it
(Well, you need to fight for your own)
That's right, I'm in it
(Then don't let me at your table)

(Fist jumps in the air, you love flame wars)
(I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes)

[Kanye West:]
Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!

[Assassin, {Kanye West}:]
{That's why I'm in it and I can't get out}
That's all dem can do (Say wah? Say wah? Say wah? Say wah?)
{That's why I'm in it and I can't get out}
(That's all dem can do)
That's all dem can do
We deal with action ting

{That's right I'm in it}
[Justin Vernon:]
I'll be gone long, grab that ass, shed your clothes

[Justin Vernon:]
Say you long for me, for you
Lay it off with all your rules
Star fucker

[Kanye West:]
Time to take it too far now
Uh, Michael Douglas out the car now
Uh, got the kids-and-the-wife life
Uh, but can't wake up from the nightlife
Uh, I'm so scared of my demons
Uh, I go to sleep with a nightlight
Uh, my mind move like a Tron bike
Uh, pop a wheelie on the Zeitgeist
Uh, I'm finna start a new movement
Uh, being led by the drums
Uh, I'm a rap-lic priest
Uh, gettin' head by the nuns
Uh, they don't play what I'm playin'
Uh, they don't see what I'm sayin'
Uh, they be ballin' in the D-League
Uh, I be speakin' Swaghili

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Breeze
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
Breeze
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Blood on the leaves
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Breeze
Yeah I told you to wait

So I'mma need a little more time now
Blood on the leaves
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Breeze
Yeah, I thought you could wait

These bitches surroundin' me
Black bodies
All want somethin' out me
Swinging in the southern breeze

Then they talk about me
Breeze
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Strange fruit hanging
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
From the poplar trees
Now I know you naughty
From the poplar trees
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
'Stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly

And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me

Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you

Black bodies
Before the glory
Swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
I know there ain't wrong with me

Strange fruit hanging
Something strange's happening
From the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

You could've been somebody
We could've, we could've been somebody
Or was it all our first party
When we tried our first molly

And came out of our body
And came out of our body

Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyers?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the Nola

Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Black bodies
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Swinging in the southern breeze
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down with my niggas
Breeze
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

To all my second string bitches, trying to get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyonce, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like "Bad bitch alert"
He Instagram his watch like "Mad rich alert"
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two thousand dollar bag with no cash in your purse

Now you sittin' courtside
Wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated
I call that apartheid

Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that

Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got

On and on that alimony
She got you homie
'Til death but do your part
Unholy matrimony

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze
Breeze
Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees
From the poplar trees

Breeze breeze
Blood on the leaves

Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

I need to call it off, I need to make it known
'Nother one, something gone, Capricorn
Dancing out on the lawn, fancy like the things she likes
She lives her life, I'm living mine

[Bridge:]
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop it and spray

[Verse:]
Maybe it's cause she into Leos
And I was into trios, plus all the trips to Rio
Couldn't have helped, it's gettin' cold
Better bring your ski clothes, pick it through the keyhole
The door locked by myself and I'm feelin' it right now
Cause it's the time when my heart got shot down
Blocka-blocka, blocka, blocka-blocka, blocka
Pour a little champagne, cranberry vodka
Feelin' lied to like parents never said you adopted
Your feelings like Zulu, then nothing is a Shaka
I hit her with Jamaican dick, I'm the new Shabba
She lookin' for her daddy, call me Big Poppa
On to the next saga
Focus on the future and let the crew knock her
Star Wars fur, yeah I'm rockin' Chewbacca
The one Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka

[Bridge: Popcaan]
All dem a gwaan dem a dem a dem a gwaan
Dem a gwaan gwaan gwaan, chop, chop chop

None ah dem have the guts to bust the SK

Ohh

If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
If you love me so much then why'd you let me go?
Let me go, let me go

Rockstar bitch call me Elvis
M.O.B, she call me selfish
Success got 'em jealous
Shorty's killing, while I'm drilling
Tattoos, how they break the news
It was real if you made the news
Last night my bitches came in twos
And they both suck like they came to lose
Dropped out the first day of school
Cause niggas got cocaine to move
I be going hard, I got a name to prove
Killing 'em, honey how I make the pain improve

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Kanye West:]
This the greatest shit in the club
Since "In Da Club"
It's so packed I might ride around
On my bodyguard's back like Prince in the club
She say "Can you get my friends in the club?"
I say "Can you get my Benz in the club?"
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evening end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancing close to him
Yeezus just rose again

[King Louie:]
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down
We can send this bitch up, it can't go down

[Beenie Man:]
Memories don't live like people do
They always 'member you
Whether things are good or bad
It's just the memories that you have

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge:]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound

[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 1:]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turned the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Kanye West:]
Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches
Bound

[Hook:]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 2:]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

[Kanye West:]
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth
Bound

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)
