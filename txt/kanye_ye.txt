[Francis and the Lights:]
I know, I know, I know, I know, know
I know, I know, I know, I know, know

[Kanye West:]
I, I know it, I know it

The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so...
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always inside the darkest
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say don't say this, don't say that
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I love myself way more than I love you, so
The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
I think this is the part where I'm supposed to say something good to compensate it
So it doesn't come off bad
But sometimes I think really bad things
Really, really, really bad things
And I love myself way more than I love you
See if I was trying to relate it to more people
I'd probably say I'm struggling with loving myself because that seems like a common theme
But that's not the case here
I love myself way more than I love you
And I think about killing myself
So best believe, I thought about killing you today
Premeditated murder

I called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins
I called up the Muslims, said I'm 'bout to go dumb
Get so bright it's no sun, get so loud I hear none
Screamed so loud got no lungs, hurt so bad I go numb
Time to bring in the drums, that prrt-pum-pum-pum
Set the Newtone on 'em, set the nuke off on 'em
I need coconut rum, I taste coke on her tongue
I don't joke with no one, they'll say he die so young
I done had a bad case of too many bad days
Got too many bad traits
Used the floor for ashtrays
I don't do shit halfway, I'ma clear the cache
I'ma make my name last, put that on my last name
It's a different type of rules that we obey
Ye, Ye, Ye season, nigga, we obey
We was all born to die, nigga DOA
Niggas say they hero, mhm, I don't see no cake
Mhm, I don't see no, mhm, yeah, I don't see no, mhm
If I wasn't signed to so hard there'd be no Shay
Buckwheat ass nigga, it's 'gon be otay
Young nigga shit, nigga, we don't age
I thought I was past my Deebo ways
Even when I went broke, I ain't break
How you gon' hate? Nigga, we go way back
To when I had the braids and you had the wave cap
Drop a pimp of the fade and I'm on my way ASAP
Don't get socked in the mouth, you know homie don't play that
Pay the fire marshal bill 'cause this shit done got way packed
They wanna see me go ape (ape, ape)
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
All you gotta do is speak on Ye
Don't get your tooth chipped like Frito-Lay


Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2CB, huh?
Is he gon' make it? TBD, huh
Thought I was gon' run, DMC, huh?
I done died and lived again on DMT, huh
See, this a type of high that won't come down
This the type of high that get you gunned down
Yeezy, Yeezy trollin' OD, huh?
Turn TMZ to Smack DVD, huh?
Russell Simmons wanna pray for me too
I'ma pray for him 'cause he got #MeToo'd
Thinkin' what if that happened to me too
Then I'm on E! News

Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
Shit can get menacin', frightenin', find help
Sometimes I scare myself, myself

Ayy, hospital band a hundred bands, fuck a watch
Hundred grand'll make your best friends turn to opps
I hear y'all bringin' my name up a lot
Guess I just turned the clout game up a notch
See, y'all really shocked but I'm really not
You know how many girls I took to the titty shop?
If she get the ass with it, that's a 50 pop
I still bring the bad bitches in the city out
Uh, just a different type of leader
We could be in North Korea, I could smoke with Wiz Khalifa, uh Told my wife I've never seen her
After I hit it, bye Felicia, that's the way that I'ma leave it up

Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
See this is why all the bitches fuck with Ye, fuck what they talk about
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
They take me on meds, off meds ask yourself
Shit could get menacin', frightenin', find help
Ask your homegirl right now, look, you had a shot at Ye
Sometimes I scare myself, myself
You drop everything

Tweakin', tweakin' off that 2CB, huh?
This is why your bitches fuck with me, huh
Smash, she gon' end up on TV, huh?
Last thing that you ever wanna see, huh
I can feel the spirits all around me
I think Prince and Mike was tryna warn me
They know I got demons all on me
Devil been tryna make an army
They been strategizin' to harm me
They don't know they dealin' with a zombie
Niggas been tryna test my Gandhi
Just because I'm dressed like Abercrombie

You see? You see?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout
That's why I fuck with Ye
That's my third person
That's my bipolar shit, nigga what?
That's my superpower, nigga ain't no disability
I'm a superhero! I'm a superhero!
Agghhhh!

[Valee:]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle

[Ty Dolla $ign:]
Fuck it up, fuck it up
Pussy good, go and back it up
Pipe her up, I'ma pipe her up
Make her mine, I done fell in love
[Valee:]
Juicy thing, make that pussy say
"One more time, baby, do it big
Make it cry, come, go hold this shit."

Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle

[Kanye West:]
If I pull up with a Kerry Washington
That's gon' be an enormous scandal, I could have Naomi Campbell
And still might want me a Stormy Daniels
Sometimes, you gotta bag the boss up
I call that taking Corey Gambles
Find yourself up in the food court
You might have to enjoy your sample
All these thots on Christian Mingle, almost what got Tristan single
If you don't ball like him or Kobe
Guarantee that bitch gonna leave you
Ayy, time is extremely valuable and I prefer to waste it
On girls that's basic, that's just some Ye shit
Right now let's do what we want
Let's have a threesome with you and the blunt
I love your titties, 'cause they prove
I can focus on two things at once

[Valee:]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[Kanye West:]
Let me hit it raw like fuck the outcome
Ayy, none of us would be here without cum
Ayy, if it ain't all about the income
Ayy, let me see you go ahead and spend some
Ayy, if you driving 'round in some Dri-Fit
Ayy, I'ma think that you the type to dry snitch
Hm, mhm, if I see you pull up with the three stripes
Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch

[Valee:]
Yeah, you supermodel thick
Damn, that ass bustin' out the bottom, I'ma lose my mind in it
Crazy that medulla oblongata
Get to rubbin' on my lamp, get the genie out the bottle
Get the genie out the bottle

[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist, you make me run out of my skin
And I don't feel like
And I know you wouldn't leave

[Kanye West:]
They say, "Build your own"—I said, "How, Sway?"
I said, "Slavery a choice"—they said, "How, 'Ye?"
Just imagine if they caught me on a wild day
Now I'm on fifty blogs gettin' fifty calls
My wife callin', screamin', say, "We 'bout to lose it all!"
Had to calm her down 'cause she couldn't breathe
Told her she could leave me now, but she wouldn't leave

And I know you wouldn't leave

[Jeremih:]
When somethin frees
We doin' such things
We could wait longer than this
Yes, you know you're one of these
We can run thru with the top chopped, yeah
And the sundress down, oooh

And I know you wouldn't leave

[Kanye West:]
Oh, don't bring that up, that's gon' get me sentimental
You know I'm sensitive, I got a gentle mental
Every time something happen, they want me sent to mental
We had an incident but I cover incidentals
You want me working on my messaging
When I'm thinkin' like George Jetson but sounding like George Jefferson
Then they questioning my methods then
If you tweakin' out on my texts again then I don't get reception here
I got the mind state to take us past the stratosphere
I use the same attitude that done got us here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
I live for now, I don't know what happen after here
Plus, what was meant to be was meant to be
Even if, publicly, I lack the empathy
I ain't finna talk about it, 'nother four centuries
One and one is two but me and you, that's infinity

And I know you wouldn't leave

[Choir / PARTYNEXTDOOR / Ty Dolla $ign:]
I don't feel that she's mine enough
God, I feel I couldn't have you windin' up
Butterfly in my wrist
You make me run out of my skin (run out of my skin)
And I don't feel like (uhh)
And I know you wouldn't leave (love me or hate me)

[Kanye West (Ty Dolla $ign):]
For any guy that ever fucked up (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they girl (love me or hate me)
Ever embarrassed they wife (gone when you miss me)
She told you not to do that shit (ohh)
She told you you's gon' fuck the money up
But you ain't wanna listen, did you?
Keep that same energy
Keep that same energy
Now you testing her loyalty
This what they mean when they say
"For better or for worse", huh?
For every down female that stuck with they dude
Through the best times, through the worst times
This for you

And I know you wouldn't leave


[Slick Rick:]
Believe it or not
Believe it or not

[Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi:]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still like you
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
Make no mistake, girl, I still like you

[Kanye West:]
Take the top off, let the sun come in
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Woah, for all my dogs that stayed down, we up again (yeah)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Oh, I got dirt on my name, I got white on my beard
I had debt on my books, it's been a shaky ass year
Let me make this clear, so all y'all see
I don't take advice from people less successful than me, huh?
Ain't no love lost, but the gloves off
And we up in this bitch until they turn the club off
Had to tell the dogs "Turn the snubs off"
Plus they already mad that the Cubs lost
(The Lord still shines on you)
(Believe it or not)
These two wrongs'll right you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
I was too grown in high school
(Believe it or not)
The true soul of Ice Cube
Too close to snipe you (the Lord still shines on you)
Truth told, I like you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Too bold to type you
(Believe it or not)
Too rich to fight you
Calm down, you light skin!

[Charlie Wilson & Kid Cudi:]
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (make no)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (no way)
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you
(Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you (no way)
Make no mistake, girl, I still love you

[Shirley Ann Lee:]
Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I will wear a starry crown
[PARTYNEXTDOOR:]
Some day, some day
Some day I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on some days
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm
Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Smokin' marijuana
Now that I'm livin' high, I do whatever I wanna, some day

[Kid Cudi:]
I've been tryin', to make you love me
But everything I try, just takes you further from me

[Kanye West:]
Some day we gon' set it off, some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all, on a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone, and they'll pray, no, oh, no
Sometimes I take all the shine, talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind, I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds, caught between space and time
This now, with the world in mind, but maybe some day

[Kid Cudi:]
I've been tryin', to make you love me
But everything I try, just takes you further from me

[070 Shake:]
Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free

[070 Shake:]
Fallin', dreamin', talkin' in your sleep
I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', finding
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me

Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Kanye West:]
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I'll make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just being silly
I answered the door, like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga do we have a problem?
Matter of fact Marlon, this ain't Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine and not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
Now she cuttin' class and hangin' with friends
You break a glass and say it again
She can't comprehend the danger she's in
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas, but yesterday is dead, yeah
Moment of silence, next she'll be off to college and then at the altar
'Cause she know that niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players, 'til niggas have daughters

[070 Shake & Ty Dolla Sign:]
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (night, night)
They gotta repeat the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off

[Nicki Minaj:]
I'm sayin' it like...
I want a daughter like Nicki, aww man, I promise
I'ma turn her to a monster, but no menagés
I don't know how you saying it, but let 'em hear this
