In the middle of a railroad track (thunder)

And I knew there was no turning back (thunder)
My mind raced
And I thought what could I do? (thunder)

Beating in my heart
The thunder of guns (yeah)

There's fightin' on the left
And marching on the right
Don't look up in the sky
You're gonna die of fright
Here comes the razor's edge

You're livin' on the edge
Don't know wrong from right
They're breathin' down you're neck
You're runnin' out of lives
Here comes the razor's edge
Here comes the razor's edge
The razor's edge

Razor's edge to raise the dead
Razor's edge to cut to shreds
To raise the dead

Here comes the razor's edge
Here comes the razor's edge

To cut to shreds

Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the day
I just can't wait till Christmas time
When I can roll em' in the hay

Easy come, easy go
Have a good time, with lots of dough
Slippin' up high, slippin' down low
Love 'em and leave 'em, on with the show

I like female form, in minimum dress
Money to spend with a capital "S"
Get a date with the woman in red
Wanna be in heaven with three in a bed
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
But I want it, but it don't matter
She got it and I can't get it
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress for Christmas
I want a mistress
For Christmas

Easy come, easy go
Slippin' high, slippin' low
He got it, I want it
They got it, I can't have it
I want it, don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it
He got it, and I want it
They got it, and I can't have it
But I want it, it don't matter
She got it, and I can't get it
Mistress for Christmas, you know what I'm talking about
Mistress for Christmas, they're gonna send me down, send me down
Mistress for Christmas, I want the woman in red at the bottom of my bed
Mistress for Christmas

I can hear you coming down my snow stick

I wanna ride on your reindeer honey
And ring the bells

Got the devil in you
Got the devil in me
Play a dangerous tune
Come on dance with thee
You gotta
Throw your fists up
Shout your mouth off
Beat the walls down
Get tough, freak out
Rock your little rock your little
Rock your little heart out

Got everything you want
Got everything you need
Don't worry about the cost
Just sell your soul to me
You gotta
Bring the house down
Beat the drums loud
Bleed your life dry
Climb on let's fly
Rock your little rock your little
Rock your little heart out
Rock rock your little heart out
Rockin' on down

Put your foot down
Beat your chest hard
Blow your brains out
Feel her shout loud
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out
Rock your heart out, rock your heart out

Sweet apple pie
Standing in the street
Hands outta line
Looking for some meat
She'll take you high when you feel her sting
She'll make you fly
Then you know you're comin'
Who all need it, who
Who all need it, you
Who all need it who all need it
You all breathe it
We all need it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time

She's making eyes
At everything she meet
It ain't it a crime
When she make you pump heat
She'll make you fly because that's her thing
She'll make you dry
Then you know you're broken in
Who all need it, you
Who all need it, yes you do
You all breathe it
We all need it
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line
Are you ready for a good time
Then get ready for the night line

Gettin' bombed out on booze
Got nothin' to lose
Run outta money
Disposable blues
Sleazy hotels like livin' in hell
The girls on the hustle with nothin' to sell
Want something for nothing it's always the same
Keep pushin' an' shovin' and I'm down on the game
Always in trouble
Forever detained
Goodbye goodbye goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Well spread out the news there's a free man loose
Back out of jail and chasin' some floos'
Bad luck has changed
Broken the chains
Laid out a claim for monetary gains
Wantin' what's coming all for the take
Freedom for lovin' an lust for the taste
Eyes are wide open
Wild to the game
Goodbye goodbye goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck

Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Bad luck
Bad luck
Goodbye and good riddance to bad luck
Goodbye good riddance to bad luck
Broken the chains of bad luck
Bye bye bye bad luck
Thrown of the chains of bad luck

Goodbye good riddance
To bad luck
