Ruby, Ruby where you been so long
Done took to drinkin' whiskey
Baby since you been gone
Ain't no one I know
Do it good as you
Lickin' on that lickin' stick
The way you do
You got the lips to make a strong man weak
And a heathen pray
Give you a tip
It ain't just the way you speak
You know it's just the way you go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Mary, Mary you're the one for me
And the way you hum
Sting me like a bumble bee
I'll be round to see you 'bout
'bout half past ten
Ain't felt this good
Since I don't know when
You got the touch that I need so much
In your finger tips
I got the honey that ya love to taste
On those lovely lips
So go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down

Baby rub it on
Ya know it's sticky and it's sweet
And it's been so long
Ain't no one else
Got a touch like you
I let you do the things to me I let no other woman do
Feels good
Feels good
Oh yeah
You do it like you should
Oh yeah
I love you so much
Make me glad I'm a man
Go down, go down, go down, go down
Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down

Well it's a dog eat dog
Eat cat too
Frenchy eat frog
And I eat you
Business man when you make a deal
Do you know who you can trust
Do you sign your life away
Do you write your name in dust
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog
Read the news
Someone win
Someone lose
Up's above and downs below
And limbo's in between
Up you win
Down you lose
It's anybody's game
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

And it's a eye for eye
Tooth for tooth
It's a lie
That's the truth
See the blind man on the street
Lookin' for somethin' free
Hear the kind man ask his friend
Hey, what's in it for me
Hey, hey, hey
Every dog has it's day
It's a dog eat dog
Dog eat dog

Dog eat dog, dog eat dog
Dog eat dog, dog eat dog

In the beginning
Back in nineteen fifty five
Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tchaikovsky had the news
He said let there be sound
There was sound
Let there be light
There was light
Let there be drums
There was drums
Let there be guitar
There was guitar
Let there be rock

And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowin' up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There was fifteen million fingers
Learnin' how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light
Sound
Drums
Guitar
Let there be rock

One night in the club called the shakin' hand
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd
Let there be rock

On the day I was born the rain fell down
There was trouble brewin' in my home town
It was the seventh day I was the seventh son
And it scared the hell out of every one
They said stop
I said go
They said fast
I said slow
They said yes
I said no
I do the bad boy boogie

Bein' a bad boy ain't that bad
I had me more dirty women than most men ever had
All you women come along with me
And I'll show how good a bad boy can be
I said right
And they said left
I said east
And they said west
I said up
And they said down
I do the bad boy boogie
All over town

I wouldn't tell you no story
Tell you no lie
I was born to love till the day I die
I just line em up
And I knock em down
And they all came a runnin' when the word got around
Just keep runnin'
I said up
They said down
They said straight
I said round
They said lost
I said found
I said free
They said bound
Bad boy boogie
Do the bad boy
Bad boy boogie
Bad boy boogie

Cop this
I'm hot, and when I'm not
I'm cold as ice
Get out of my way
Just Step aside
Or pay the price

What I want I take
What I don't I break
And I don't want you
With a flick of my knife
I can change your life
There's nothing you can do

I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child, yes I am
I'm a problem child
And I'm wild

Make my stand
No man's land
On my own
Man in blue
It's up to you
The seed is sown

What I want I stash
What I don't I smash
And you're on my list
Dead or alive
I got a .45
And I never miss

I'm a problem child, hey
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Just runnin' wild

Just watch your step

Every night
Street light
I drink my booze
Some run
Some fight
But I win they lose
What I need I like
What I don't I fight
And I don't like you
Say bye bye
While you're still alive
Your time is through

Cause I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Even my mother hates me
I'm a problem child
I'm a problem child
(Problem child, problem child)
(Problem child, problem child), you got your problems I got mine
(Problem child, problem child)
(Problem child, problem child)
Problem child
I'm a problem child
Problem child
And I'm running wild
I'm a problem child
(Problem child, problem child...)

I never smoked me no cigarettes
I never drank much booze
But I'm only a man don't ya understand
And a man can sometimes lose
You gave me somethin' I never had
Pulled me down with you
Hit me up with a big hunka love
Hope you can pull me through
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

Woman you give to me
More 'n I can take
But listen honey
I don't mind
You're a habit I don't wanna break
Don't want me none of the harder stuff
Don't need it anymore
I'm in hell
And I'm sinkin' fast
And I don't need no cure
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
Ain't nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

I'm as happy as a man can be
Too far gone to save
Died of love
And plenty of
Just write on my grave
I overdosed on you
I overdosed on you
Crazy but it's true
There's nothin' I can do
I overdosed on you

On you
On you
All over you
All over you
All over
I overdosed
Overdosed
Overdosed
On you
Overdosed

Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down
Fool me around
Why she do it to me
Out for satisfaction
Any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be
She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She' gotta see
Pours my beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be

Spends my money
Drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinkin'
Hey, just a minute
Somethin' ain't right
Disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
The shame you
Playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies
Don't mind her playin' demon
As long as it's with me
If this is hell
Then let me say
It's heavenly
Hell ain't a bad place to be

Late at night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears me apart
Brings out the devil in me

Hell ain't a bad place to be
I said
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Hell
Ain't a bad place to be
Hell
Ain't a bad place to be

Wanna tell you story
About woman I know
When it comes to lovin'
She steals the show
She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
Fourt'two thirt'ninefiftysix
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things
Doin' all the things you do
Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighin' in at nineteen stone
You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Honey you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one who turn me
Only one who turn me on
All through the night time
Right around the clock
To my surprise
Rosie never stops
She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman

Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
