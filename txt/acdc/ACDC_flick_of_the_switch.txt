Dog day Tuesday
Hope that girl she come today
Hard life it's a city life
Sweat keep pourin' down
I've got my feet up like to love
Through the dawn till I've blown
All I want's her lovin' down
Love the way she move around
Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's blown a fuse
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power

You've got a love life up all night
Darkest hour at the dead of night
Seen her walkin' down the street
The kind of woman that brings on heat
Loved her dusk till dawn
Come the morning she was gone
Took me out to my surprise
Money's gone left high and dry
Need no excuse
To let it all hang loose
My body's blown a fuse
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You'll end up torn to shreds

Don't need no excuse
My body's blown a fuse
Rising power
We'll raise the night
Rising power
Rising power
We'll wake the dead
Rising power
You'll end up torn to shreds

Rise
Rise
Rise
Rising power
The power rise
From you

Yonder she walks

Yonder she walks
Hitting 103
A little tongue in cheek
Hot personality
She bring on the flames
And it's burning it's burning
My body's achin' tossin' and turnin'
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
This house is on fire
And the flame is gonna burn in

Needing quarantine
She got me red hot and wired
Call on emergency
She bring on the flames

And the flame is gonna burn in

Well there's a love gone down on mine
Suicidal voltage line
She send signals out of distress
She devil she evil
She's got you reelin' on a rockin' machine

With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch
She'll blow you sky high
With a flick of the switch
With a flick of the switch
She can satisfy

She's gonna blow you all sky high
Flash the eye electrify
A power force you should feel
She devil she evil
She's get you screamin' on a lightnin' machine

With a flick of the switch
Flick of the switch

Give you pain
Blow your brains

Blow your brain
She gonna put the light out on
You

Freeze said the man cruising the beat
You get your hands up spread your feet
Don't you move an inch I heard him say
Or you'll be doing time until the judgement day
And he said
Don't tell me no lies give me alibis
Cause if you cross my path you'll be doing life
It's a dirty lie
It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We gotta shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

It's lookin' like a set-up

Take a dime said the man you can make one call
You got a one way ticket to the county hall
When then judge looked high and I looked low
When he smiled at me it was a one man show
He said
2 to 5 the jury decides
Double parole if you survive
It's a dirty lie
It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We gotta shakedown
Another nervous shakedown

Lord they're gonna get you this time
And throw away the key

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
You got a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
We gotta shakedown

Lord they're gonna get you this time throw away the key

It's a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Another shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
You got a shakedown (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (another nervous shakedown)

Shake it down shake it down (and it's a nervous shakedown)
Well it's a shakedown (another nervous shakedown)
Shake it down shake it down (and it's a nervous shakedown)
It's a shakedown
It's a shakedown
On

Yeah, yeah
The blood in my veins was runnin' right through my brain
There was a cop with a gun
Who was runnin' around insane
Three fifty arrests
No bullet proof vest
Now ain't that a shame
We wanted to play
Play for the crowd
Law said no way
Cause you're on your way out
Bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium

The place was a jumpin'
And the booze was going down
There's a curfew at ten
And you been working overtime
We don't play just for pay
So we'd like to stay
Stay just the same
He gave me a crack in the back with his gun
Hurt me so bad I could feel the blood run
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium, yeah
Who's to blame
It's a shame

Bedlam
In Belgium
It was bedlam

Getting ready
Stayed on the stage cops in a rage
Crowd yelled for more it was war, war, war
Bedlam in Belgium
It was bedlam in Belgium
Bedlam in Belgium
Came for a good time and left on the run
Bedlam in Belgium

It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam (in Belgium)
It was bedlam
And the law got the drop on

With a gun in my hand
Lookin' for a woman that'll understand

Lovin' on a last stand
Outlaw quick draw
