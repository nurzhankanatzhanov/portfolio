Loose lips sink ships
So come aboard for a pleasure trip

A pirate of my lovin' needs

Blowin' out the fuse box

No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
No mercy from me
Tell no truth an' tell no lies
Cross your heart and hope to die
Never give what you can't take back
Scratch like a cat
If you inject your venom
It'll be your last attack

No mercy for the bad if they want it
No mercy for the bad if they plead
No mercy for the bad if they need it
V.e.n.o.m.

Got no heart, no feel no pain
Take your soul and leave a stain
Come choose your victim

Inject it all
Stick it in

Get it all
Inject the venom

Inject it all

Inject the venom

Crashed out of the market
Out on the floor
Washed up on the shore
Bombed outta the city
Out of the door
Blown up against the wall
Put out of the picture
Axe about to fall
Walk before you crawl
Dragged down to the bottom
Screamin' for air
The shark must get his share
You can see it comin'
Miles and miles away
Women drink and money
Are gonna make you pay
Snowballed, ooh yeah
Snowballed, they done it again
Snowballed, makin' me blind
Snowballed

The howl of the wolf
Snow in his eyes
Waitin' to take you by surprise
Eye of the needle
Heat of the fight
Watch those teeth cause they're ready to bite
You can see it comin'
Miles and miles away
Women drink and money
Are gonna make you pay
You've been
Snowballed, yes you have
Snowballed, you've been fooled again
Snowballed, that's all
Snowballed

Snowballed, snowballed, snowballed, snowballed
Snowballed, snowballed, snowballed, snowballed
You been snowballed
You been snow, you been snow, you been snow
Snowballed, balled balled balled

Black shadow hangin' over your shoulder
Black mark up against your name
Your green eyes couldn't get any colder
There's bad poison runnin' thru your veins
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you

Black widow weavin' evil notion
Dark secret's bein' spun in your web
Good men goin' down in your ocean
They can't swim cos their tied to your bed
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you
You're just crying wolf
I sometimes wonder where you park your broom
Oh black widow

C'mon weave your web
Down in your ocean
You got 'em tied to your bed
With your dark dark secret's
And your green green eyes
You black widow

Evil, walks behind you
Evil, sleeps beside you
Evil, talks arouse you
Evil, walks behind you
Evil walks behind you
Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you

Evil sleeps beside you
Evil talks arouse you
Evil walks behind you

You're so bad

Call of a dog
Cry of a bitch
The cream of a dream is the cause of the itch
Call on the doctor
Cash on demand
If I get enough rope might even hang
C.o.d. care of the devil
C.o.d. the devil in me
C.o.d. care of the devil
Care of the devil in me

The curse of love is the cause of the pain
The crime of the day is when you do it again
Call on the doctor
Cash on demand
If you give them a finger they'll take off your hand
C.o.d. care of the devil
C.o.d. the devil in me
C.o.d. care of the devil
Care of the devil in me
Down to the devil with me

Call of a dog
Cry of a bitch
The sign of the sinners the size of his itch
Cry
C.o.d. care of the devil
C.o.d. the devil in me
C.o.d. care of the devil
C.o.d.
C.o.d. care of the devil
C.o.d. the devil in me
C.o.d. care of the devil
C.o.d. care of the devil in me

I'm paying
Paying
I'm paying c.o.d
Care of the devil
Care of the devil in me
It's the curse of love

Black sheep and a renegade
Hot feet in the cool of the shade
The street jungle and the tough childhoods
Examinations done no good
Got crow bars and hot wired cars
Sneak thieves and cheap cigars
No rebellion not today
I get my kicks in my own way
Right ok
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule

Tough breaks in the neighbourhood
A hard case who's up to no good
Livin' like trash a society rash
Ready to break and ready to dash
A bad deal and a real rough ride
And doin' time on the other side
No rebellion not today
Get my kicks in my own way
Right ok
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Tough breaks

Regulation ties
Regulation shoes
Those regulation fools
With the regulation rules
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready to rule
Just keep on breakin' the rules
Breakin' the rules
Get ready
Just keep on breakin' the rules
C'mon get ready
Get ready
Get ready
Ready to rule
Take off your ties
And your regulation shoes
You're nothing but a bunch of regulation fools
And your damn regulation rules
I'm gonna do things my own way
Everyday, everyday,
In everyway
I ain't gonna pay no attention to your rules

Who your leader who your man
Who will help you fill your hand
Who's your friend and who's your foe
Who's your Judas you don't know
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long long knife

Where's that saviour
Where's that light
When your prayin' for your life
Who's that fightin' back to back
Who's defending who's attack
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long
Long knife

Stab him in the back

It's the night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
Night of the long knives
It's the night of the long long knife

It's the night of the
Night of the
Night of the long long knife

Blinded by a bright beam
Shattered by the windscreen
Stunned by the whiplash
I'm a victim of a bad crash
I can't do nothin' right
I never sleep at night
Can't even start a fight
My feet have left the ground
Spinnin' round and round
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down

Beaten by a blind bend
Wrong way up a dead end
Screamin' through a speed trap
As I tear into a tail back
You know I can't do nothin' right
No I never sleep at night
And I can't even start a fight
Well my feet have left the ground
Spinnin' round and round
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
It keeps a tumblin' down
C'mon slide

I'm slippin' down
I got my hands in the fire

I'm slidin' on a oil slick
Burnin' on a bad trip
Yes and nothin's gonna change it
No I can't do nothin' right
Can't even sleep at night
My feet have left the ground
I'm spinnin' round and round
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down
Spellbound
My world keeps a tumblin' down, down down
Spellbound
My world
Keeps a tumblin'
Down
