They say that you play too loud
Well baby that's tough
They say that you got too much
Can't get enough
They tell you that you look a fool
Baby I'm a fool for you
They say that your mind's diseased, shaky stuff
It's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

You say that you want respect
Honey for what
For everything that you done for me
Thanks a lot
Get up off your bended knees
You can set your mind at ease
My temperature's runnin' hot
I been waitin' all night
For a bite of what you got

It's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

It's a hard life

Damnation, they're putting you down
Damnation, all over town
Damnation, Cause you're way outta reach
Living on the street you gotta practice what you preach
An it's a rock 'n' roll damnation
Ma's own whippin' boy
Rock 'n' roll damnation
Take a chance while you still got the choice

Damnation, you left a happy home
Damnation, To live on your own
Damnation, You wanna live in sin
It's a rock 'n' roll
Damnation, Just a bundle of joy
Damnation, you're a toy for a boy
Damnation, you got the dollars in your eye
Always chasin' that pie in the sky
Rock 'n' roll damnation

I know that it's evil
I know that it's gotta be
I know I ain't doing much
Doing nothing means a lot to me
Living on a shoestring
A fifty cent millionaire
Open to charity
Rock 'n' roll welfare
Sitting in my Cadillac
Listening to my radio
Suzy baby get on in
Tell me where she wanna go
I'm living in a nightmare
She's looking like a wet dream
I got myself a Cadillac
But I can't afford the gasoline
I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

Get myself a steady job
Some responsibility
Can't even feed my cat
On social security
Hiding from the rent man
Oh it make me wanna cry
Sheriff knocking on my door
Ain't it funny how the time flies
Sitting on my sailing boat
Sipping on my champagne
Suzy baby all at sea
Say she wanna come again
Feeling like a paper cup
Floating down a storm drain
Got myself a sailing boat
But I can't afford a drop of rain
I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
Down payment blues

Down payment blues
Down payment blues
Down payment blues

I got holes in my shoes
And I'm way overdue
I got the
Down payment blues

She had the word
Had the way
The way of letting me know
She knew the game
Called the play
She hit me low
Said now you go your way
I'll go mine
And that's the start
Doctor, doctor
Ain't no cure
For the pain in my heart

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

Don't need no drink
Don't need no drug
Don't need no sympathy
Sooner or later
Send me a bill
For what she's doing to me
Operator
Long distance lips
On the telephone
Come tomorrow
Come to grips
With being all alone

Gimme a bullet to bite on, something to chew
Gimme a bullet to bite on, and I'll make believe
I'll make believe it's you

A bullet to bite on
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Come on now
Gimme a bullet to bite on
Bullet to chew
I'll make believe it's you
I'll make believe it's you
Gimme a bullet to bite on
You're a bullet baby
I want a bullet to bite on

Ya see it on television every day
Hear it on the radio
It ain't humid but it sure is hot
Down in Mexico
Boss man tryin' to tell me
Beginnin' of the end
Sayin' it'll bend me
Too late my friend

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half

Now I'm the kinda guy that keeps his big mouth shut
It don't bother me
Somebody kickin' me when I'm up
Leave me in misery
I never shot nobody
Don't ever carry a gun
I ain't done nothin' wrong
I'm just havin' fun

Riff raff
It's good for a laugh
Riff raff
Go on and laugh yourself in half

Diamonds and dust
Poor man last
Rich man first
Lamborghini's, caviar
Dry martini's, Shangrila
I got a burnin' feeling
Deep inside of me
It's a yearnin'
But I'm gonna set it free
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Let me roll ya baby

Ladders and snakes
Ladders give
Snakes take
Rich man poor man
Beggar man thief
You ain't got a hope in hell
That's my belief
Fingers Freddy, Diamond Jim
They're getting ready
Look out I'm coming in
So spin that wheel
Cut that pack
And roll them loaded dice
Bring on the dancin' girls and put the Champagne on ice
I'm goin' in
To sin city
I'm gonna win
In sin city
Where the lights are bright
Do the town tonight
I'm goin' in
To sin city

Well I tied my baby to the railroad track
Cannonball down the line
Givin' that woman just one more chance
To give it to me one more time
Engineer wishin' he was home in bed
Dreamin' 'bout Casey Jones
Wide eyed woman half a mile ahead
Thinkin' 'bout broken bones
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love

Heavenly body flyin' across the sky
Superman was outta town
Come on honey gotta change your tune
Cause it's a long way down
Clark Kent lookin' for a free ride
Thinkin' about Lois Lane
It's a bird it's a plane it's suicide
And that'd be a shame
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love
But what's next to the moon

Long arm lookin' for a finger print
Tryin' to find a mystery clue
Hittin' me with the third degree
Working on the thumb screw
All right officer I confess
Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack
It's your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love guaranteed
Your love that I want
It's your love that I need
It's your love gotta have
It's your love
What's next to the moon

Feel the pressure rise
Hear the whistle blow
Bought a ticket of her own accord
To I dunno
Packed her heart in a travellin' bag
And never said bye bye
Something missing in the neighbourhood
Of her cryin' eyes
I stirred my coffee with the same spoon
Knew her favourite tune
Gone shootin'
My baby gone shootin'

Wrapped herself around
Like a second skin
Backed her favourite nag
But she could never win
I took an offer in another town
She took another pill
She was runnin' in overdrive
A victim of overkill
She never made it past the bedroom door
What was she aiming for
Gone shootin'
She's gone
Gone gone gone

Gone shootin'
My baby's gone shootin'

Gone shooting, how am I gonna get her down
Gone shooting, look out look out look out
Gone shooting, she can hurt someone
Gone shooting, yeah she sure is loaded
Gone shooting, she's gone gone gone gone she's gone
Gone shooting

Well I been up to my neck in trouble
Up to my neck in strife
Up to my neck in misery
For most of my life
I've been a fool
And you know what a fool can do
I'm telling you
You come along when I needed you
Now I'm up
I'm up to my neck in you

And I been up to my neck in pleasure
Up to my neck in pain
I been up to my neck on the railroad track
Waitin' for the train
To cruise on through
I figured my time was due
It's way over due
You come along and you pulled me through
Now I'm up
Up to my neck in you
Don't it feel good

I been up to my neck in whiskey
I been up to my neck in wine
I been up to my neck in wishin'
That this neck wasn't mine
I'm a loser
That ain't lost it
Baby you were to good
To good to be true
What you done no one else could do
Now I'm up
I'm up to my neck in you
It feels good
You come along when I needed you
I'm up to my neck in you

Two face woman with your two face lies
I hope your two face livin's made you satisfied
Told me baby I'm was you're only one
While ya been runnin' round town with every mothers son

Two times told about a woman like you
Two times told about the things you do
I used to think that you were sugar and spice
I should have listened to my ma's advice

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end
And I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again

Two face woman such a cryin' shame
Double or nothin' you're all the same
You run around hope you had your fun
You never know who's gonna win
Til' the race been
Run

Kicked in the teeth again
Sometimes you lose sometimes you win
Kicked in the teeth again
Ain't this misery ever gonna end
I been kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth
Kicked in the teeth again
