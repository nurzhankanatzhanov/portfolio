Livin' easy
Lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Askin' nothin'
Leave me be
Takin' everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell

No stop signs
Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey, Satan
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rockin' band
Hey, mamma
Look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land

I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Don't stop me

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell

(highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell
(highway to hell) highway to hell
(highway to hell) highway to hell
(highway to hell)

And I'm goin' down
All the way
I'm on the highway to hell

I been around the world
I've seen a million girls
Ain't one of them got
What my lady she got
She stealin' the spotlight
Knocks me off my feet
She's enough to start a landslide
Just a walkin' down the street
Wearin' dresses so tight
And lookin' dynamite
About to blow me out
No doubt about it can't live without it

The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
The girls got rhythm

She's like a lethal brand
Too much for any man
She give me first degree
She really satisfy me
Love me 'til I'm legless
Achin' and sore
Enough to stop a freight train
Or start the third world war
You know I'm losin' sleep
But I'm in too deep
Like a body needs blood
No doubt about it can't live without it

The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
The girls got rhythm

You know she move like sin
And when she let me in
It's like liquid love
No doubt about it can't live without it

The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
The girls got rhythm (girls got rhythm)
You know she really got the rhythm (girls got rhythm)
She got the back seat rhythm (back seat rhythm)
Rock 'n' roll rhythm (rock 'n' roll rhythm)
The girls got rhythm

Out of my way I'm a running high
Take a chance with me and a give it a try
Ain't no woman in the world unknown
'Cause I ain't lookin' for overflow

Oh, baby I ain't got much
Resistance to your touch
Take off the high heels let down your hair
Paradise ain't far from there

I wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I wanna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) baby
I wanna walk all over you

Reflections on the bedroom wall
And there you thought you'd seen it all
We're rising falling like the sea
You're lookin' so good under me

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you) to you
I wanna walk all over
You

Moanin' groanin' stirring it up
So gimme the stage I'm gonna steal the show
Leave on the lace and turn off the light
Tonight is gonna be that night

I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over you (walk all over you)
Do anything you want me to (walk all over you)
I'm gonna walk all over
You

I'm gonna walk all over you

It was one of those nights when you turn off the lights
And everythin' comes into view
She was takin' her time I was losin' my mind
There was nothin' that she wouldn't do
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last
She knew we was makin' love
I was so satisfied, deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body
Too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She got a touch
A touch too much

She had the face of an angel smilin' with sin
The body of Venus with arms
Dealin' with danger strokin' my skin
Like a thunder and lightnin' storm
It wasn't the first, it wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard, wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body
Too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She had a touch
A touch too much
Touch me
Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much (much too much)
I really wanna feel ya (touch too much)
Girl you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
Cause you're much too much too much too much
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
Givin' me a touch (a touch too much)
Lay me down and touch (a touch too much)
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
Seems like a touch (a touch too much)
A touch too much, a touch too much, a touch too much
Touch
Come on and touch me
Yeah


Smilin' face and laughin' eyes
But you keep on tellin' me all those lies
How'd you expect me to believe
Honey I ain't that naive
Baby I got my eye on you
Cause you do all the things I want you to
Stop your cryin' and dry you tears
I ain't that wet behind the ears
You can throw me lefts
You can throw me rights
But where was you last night
Beating around the bush

Wish I knew what was on your mind
Why you bein' so unkind
Remember those nights we spent alone
Talking on the telephone
Thoughts of you goin' throw my brain
You told me that you felt the same
You said that you loved me too
But tell me who was there with you
I was talkin' birds
And you was talkin' bees
And was he down upon his knees
Beating around the bush

Your the meanest woman I've ever known
Sticks and stones won't break my bones
I know what you're lookin' for
You've eaten your cake you want some more
I'm gonna give you just one more chance
Try to save our romance
I've done everything
I'm gonna do
The rest is up to you
And you can chew it up
You can spit it out
You can let it all hang out
Beating around the bush

Chew it up
Spit it out
Let it all hang out
Beating around the bush

Whoa
Whoa, one two

Out on the town
Lookin' for a woman
Gonna gimme good love
Anybody wanna hand off me
And give me plenty of
She was standin' alone
Over by the juke box
Like she'd some thing to sell
I said baby what's the goin' price
She told me to go to hell
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Singles bar
Got my eye on a honey
Hangin' out everywhere
She might be straight
She might want my money
I really don't care, no
Said baby
Drivin' me crazy
Laid it right on the line
When a guy with a chip on his shoulder said
Toss off buddy she's mine
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames

Hey you
Angus
Shoot me, shoot
That's nice
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
Shoot
Shot down in flames
Shot down in flames
Ain't it a shame
To be shot down in flames
I don't need a thing
Don't wanna be
Shot down in flames

Goin' out on the town
Just a me and you
Gonna have ourselves a party
Just like we used to do
Nobody's, playin' Manilow
Nobody's, playin' soul
And no one's playin' hard to get
Just a good old rock 'n' roll
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

Movin' down the motorway
Got a whole lotta booze
Got myself a sweet little number
Who's got nothin' to lose
I'm gonna bend you like a g string
Conduct you like a choir
So get your body in the right place
We'll set the world on fire
Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
Alright

Get it hot, get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Get it hot, get it hot
You can get it

Come on baby
Get it hot
Make me feel good
Get it hot
Come on baby
Get it hot
Whoa yeah

It's criminal
There ought to be a law
Criminal
There ought to be a whole lot more
You get nothin' for nothin'
Tell me who can you trust
We got what you want
And you got the lust
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the streets
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
Yes you have

It's animal
Livin' in the human zoo
Animal
The shit that they toss to you
Feelin' like a christian
Locked in a cage
Thrown to the lions
On the second page
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the street
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
O positive

Blood on the rocks
Blood on the streets
Blood in the sky
Blood on the sheets
If you want blood
You got it

I want you to bleed for me

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it

You're the one I've waited for
I need your lovin'
More and more
I don't know what your name is
I don't know what your game is
I'm wanna take you tonight
Animal appetite
Cause I'm a love
Hungry man
Love
Hungry man

Don't want no conversation
I need sweet sensation
All I wanna do
Is make a meal outta you
Cause I'm a love
Hungry man, I got to get what I can

Hungry man, oh baby you're such a treat

Yes I am
A mans got to eat baby, bon appetite
I'm your
Love hungry man

Somewhere a clock strikes midnight
And there's a full moon in the sky
You hear a dog bark in the distance
You hear someone's baby cry
A rat runs down the alley
And a chill runs down your spine
And someone walks across your grave
And you wish the sun would shine
Cause no one's gonna warn you
And no one's gonna yell attack
And you don't feel the steel
Till it's hangin' out your back
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Night prowler, get outta my way
I'm the prowler, watch out tonight
Yes I'm your night prowler, when you turn out the light

Too scared to turn your light out
Cause there's somethin' on your mind
Was that a noise outside the window
What's that shadow on the blind
As you lie there naked
Like a body in a tomb
Suspended animation as I slip into your room
I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Night prowler, get outta my way
Look out for the night prowler, watch out tonight
Yes I'm the night prowler, when you turn out the light

I'm your night prowler, asleep in the day
Yes I'm your night prowler, get outta my way
Look out for the night prowler, watch out tonight
Yes I'm your night prowler, when you turn out the light
I'm your night prowler, break down your door
I'm your night prowler, crawling across your floor
I'm the night prowler, make a mess of you, yes I will
Night prowler
And I'm telling this to you
There ain't nothing
There ain't nothing
Nothing you can do

Shazbot
Nanu nanu
