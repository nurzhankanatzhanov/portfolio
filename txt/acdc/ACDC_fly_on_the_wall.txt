Fly on the wall

You can dance, through the night
Rock 'n' roll music itching to fight
Making love, drunk or stoned
Looking for dollar, get broken boned
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ends up the same, sweating out the rain

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
Watch out, there's a fly on the wall

Take a chance, take a bite
Rock 'n' roll devil take me tonight
Like a bitch, making heat
Beating on my chest, licking at my feet
It's a game, too tough to tame
Ending up the same, sweating out the rain
So watch out, there's a fly on the wall

I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

I was, trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
No escape, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take
I was trapped, like a fly on the wall
I was caged, like a zoo animal
Enraged, from the fate that you make
You're a snake, I've had all I can take

There's a fly on the Wall

See me leaning, on the bar
I got my head in a whiskey jar
Feeling good cause the city's alive
I'm getting ready to rock and jive
I get up and I slide across the floor
You wanna come an' I'll meet you at the door
No one can stop us cause we're feeling too right
We're gonna steal our way around tonight

Alright, alright
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it

I was taking, no liberties
She's getting hotter off the heat on me
I was oiling, she was slick
Licking off the sweat, her favorite trick
Help me, help me please, tame this animal, and help me to breathe
I said no, no way, you gotta come with me, all the way
OK I'll play

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it

We had the night, we had the time
She had the sugar and I had the wine
Took my hand shook me to the core
I told her not to touch but she was coming back for more
You know what for

Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Aye, aye, oh, shake your foundations
Aye, aye, oh, shake it to the floor
Make a sign

Got a screaming feeling, need a little loving healing
Want some of that stuff, cause I like a hot touch
Wanna little squeezing, just a touch and teasing
Maybe wrong, maybe right, but I like it every night

Come on baby, down my way
Were gonna make it, night and day

I want first blood, a look in the eye
Thirst blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come, back for more
First blood, first blood

Some like it hot, some like it not so hot
Cause I like a touch, and I want it so much
Come on baby, down my way
Were gonna make it every night and day

First blood, a look in the eye
Thirst blood, a need in disguise
Bad dog come back for more
First blood, first blood

Don't talk to strangers, keep away from the danger
Don't talk to strangers who smile
Keep away from the danger all the time, you just keep away
Just keep away

Red lights are flashing, there's been a misunderstanding
I'm Bruised and broke and bandaged
Through drinking all that brandy
I was, under the table but I came back for more
Gotta hit that bottle but my head hit the floor

Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Stranger, danger, don't you talk
Danger, danger, don't talk to strangers
Danger, danger, don't talk keep away

Red lights still flashing
People all still dancing in my head
I've done with thinking, about what to do
Another bout of drinking
Just one before I'm through
I was just raising hell I wasn't doing no harm
The cops could not appreciate my natural charm

Put your gear into fire
Lay your bullets on the ground
Turn your head to desire
There's a woman going down
She said she'll rack you up, all the way
Then she gonna spit you out, count your days
She says choice is yours, casually
So why don't you do what comes naturally

Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine
Gonna show you, a good time
Sink the pink, sink the pink

Got a fever running high
Give you wings to make you fly
She school you like a fool
She make you break the rules
She wanna give you a shot, hit the spot
And I'm gonna rack em up, get it hot
She said, make it good, satisfy
You know that woman got Dallas eyes

Sink the pink, it's all the fashion
Drink the drink, it's old fashioned
Gimme water, gimme wine

Sink the pink, sink the pink

Highball women that are, hot to touch
Legs do the talking, spelling out the lust
See the sugar daddies with a sweet tooth and smile
See what's hanging off him like a, wanting child
That's where you'll find me, standing proud

Playing with girls, gonna get you hot
Playing with guns, gonna get you shot
Playing with fire, gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

Bring on the showgirls and the, debutantes
Late night waitress in a, restaurant
Heading for the clubs and bars, with the flashing lights
Looking for the good time girls in their black nylon tights
Over the barrel, bottoms up

Playing with girls, gonna get you hot
Playing with guns, gonna get you shot
Playing with fire, gonna heat you up
Playing with me, you're gonna get the lot

River run dry, yeah yeah playing with fire
Wild sweet child
Playing with girls, playing with girls

Playing, playing, playing with girls, playing with girls

I like tall girls but I'll take em small
I want em all up front, I like em all
I wanna see em' strut their stuff
And lose their social grace
You play your cards right and you'll deal yourself an ace
That's where you'll find me, standing proud

Playing with girls, playing with girls
Playing with girls, playing with girls
You got the long girl, short girl
Nothing but the bad girl
Just playing with girls

I want all the women in the world

Put on the headset, get on the stage
Out on the midnight, escapade
I didn't wanna steal your thunder
I wouldn't wanna play your game
Making all the headlines, getting on the front page

Didn't even know her number, didn't even know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

Get on the red dress, slip on the lace
Up for a high heel, and a pretty face
Woman wanna get you under
Woman wanna get you tame
Loving on a hot night
Stoking up the flame

I didn't wanna know her number, I didn't wanna know her name
Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up

You can make it

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, you can make it

Stand up, stand up and take it
Stand up, stand up and make it
Stand up, stand up and face it
Stand up, stand up

Watch out, get outta my way
Did ya hear what I say

Everybody, you don't have to choose it
You don't have to prove it
It's only rock 'n' roll
Mama don' told me, papa don' scold me
Superstition, black cat in the cradle
Dancing on the table, don't you snake on me
Mama don' scold me, daddy don' scold me
Told me, show me
You know that he told me

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water

Blood money, lying through your back teeth
Fighting on the main street, breathe your last breath on me
Mama don' told me
Poor boy get home
Hot loving, trigger happy feeling
Touching up and teasing
You know it so bad
Mama don' told me, papa don' scold me
Told me, showed me
Rock 'n' rolled me

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Hell, hell, hell, give em hell

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water

Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water, come hell or high water
Come hell or high water

Come hell
Come hell
Come hell

Breaking out, about to shout
Feel the need, for one more round
Don't you struggle, don't try to bite
You want some trouble, I'm the king of vice
I'm a wrecking ball, I'm a stinging knife
Steal your money, gonna take your life
You got screaming murder, lock up your door
Double dealing, gotta have more
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business

Flesh and blood, I'm a rag 'n' bone
Bad luck message on the telephone
Don't you worry, play my game
I'll do you a favour put your soul for sale
Like a cannon ball going down the track
Need good loving, but I want it back
I was born in trouble, they gave up on me
Teacher preaching what not to be
Call me dirty, trash my name
Just tell the boys that I'm gonna be
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business

Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business, back in business again
Back in business again, back in business, back in business again

Back in business again, and I'm looking for you

Do you want love
Dirty dirty love
Do you want lust
Just a little lust
You want a bad reputation
You wanna better your score
I got the qualifications
I can open any door

Send for the man
Send for the man

You like a dream
Dirty low and mean
You're good enough to eat
You're sticky hot and sweet
Need a shot of rhythm and loving
You make a black sheep a ram
This ain't no gun in my pocket
I got the goods in my hand

Send for the man
Send for the man

Send for the man

Send for the man
Keep away from that decadent Dan
Send for the man
He won't give a damn

Send for the man, Send for the man
Send for the man, Send for the man
